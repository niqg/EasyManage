CSS Added to make website more visually appealing.

Removed entry id on front end. 

Required fields were made so that users can not add entries without a title or a contact without a name

Alert messages now show when a user can not do a task (like deleting entries), rather than just not letting them do it. 

Attaching files to entries now fully works

Viewing files right on the website now works (opens pdfs in new tab)

Now shows currently logged on user at the top right (Hello, exampleuser@mintemail.com)

Bigger description text box for more robust descriptions. 

Google calendar widget added. 


I believe this was shown at the last demo, but just in case:

    Current user logged in is tied to a user.
    Users have permissions. 
    Organization users are considered as admins with the max amount of permissions (and these can't be changed)

    You can only see data (entries, other users, etc) based on your organization now. 
      Adding items makes them belong to whatever organization you are a part of.
