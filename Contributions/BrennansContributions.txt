Design and prep:
  Helped with writing the Design document. 

  Database Modeling/Programming/Implementation w/ Dave Yeager & Nicholas Giordano (partly should go down 

  Came up with the idea to use states, which I believe Nate implemented in JS to fix some of our problems with what tab a user is in. 

  Learning everything besides MySQL and Python that I worked on was something I did. Flask, javascript, ajax, and html were rather new 
  to me.
  
  General GitHub management to help get some code from teammates up to github for various reasons. 
  
  General Debugging.

Coding:

  Wrote most of the javascript for handling adding new users (and organization users), changing their permissions, and storing them in the 
  current session for use. I believe I also wrote some of the flask endpoints for this as well. Around this time, I also was working on 
  helping coach a few teammates through how to work on flask and javascript by giving a few outlines of what code needed to be written, to 
  build them up to be able to be more confident with working on it. Had some help from Eric on the HTML (and I think Dave worked on this a 
  bit as well).


  Created a working way to add events to a user's google calendar as well as a rudimentary way to view them in a, (although some of this 
  seems to have been removed from google's javascript calendar api recently, and thus was not included in our final version.) Had some help
  from Dave and Eric.
